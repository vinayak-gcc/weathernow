This Project is made from Next.js about Weather Forecasting which shows the current temprature ,5 day forecast , humidity levels, pollution and UV index and many other fields related to the weather and the city you have selected. This app is dynamic because of which you can select a city of your choosing and get its weather in a sec. if you want to use this  project you can clone it and run it on your local machine by just adding a extra .env file which will contain the OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY .

you can get it here <https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys>

After making a account and generating a key just add it to your .env file like this :
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  and you are good to go.

Thanks for reading till this far. if u have any queries than you can ask me here and if you have any suggestions, kindly suggest me and help me in improving the website and my resume too.
